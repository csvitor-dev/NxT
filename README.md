# _NxT_: Open Sales Manager

> Maintained by **NextTrend**

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Just to clarify, **both the '_NxT_' project and the '_NextTrend_' "company" are fictitious!** The fiction is intended
> to provide a context for software development in line with what the team is learning in a college course:
> _Projeto Detalhado de Software (PDS)_ Detailed Software Design.
>
> Despite this, I put a lot of effort into making the fictional very tangible.

> [!NOTE]\
> The old project, called '**SalesWebMVC**' has been completely revamped, you can find the old `README.md` in
> [`docs/older/README.md`](./docs/older/README.md).
